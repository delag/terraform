Terraform all the things
A terraform setup to kick a `n1-standard-1` instance in GCP.

Make sure to get your [GCP service user key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey) and save it to `terraformCreds.json` in the local directory or you could just update your credentials with the provider.
